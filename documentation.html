        <p>Explain how you chose your structure, layout, and technology stack. (Qui andrà la giustificazione dei temi Immersive e Minimal).</p>
        
        <h3>4.1 Main Page</h3>  

          <p>
            The main page functions as the conceptual and visual entry point to the project. My design adopts a deliberately minimal layout in order to foreground the project’s core intent: to inform about the war in Palestine while giving voice to steadfastness, continuity, resistance, and identity. Rather than overwhelming the user with information, the main page establishes an emotional and thematic framework that prepares the visitor for deeper exploration of the content. 
          </p> 
       
          <p>
            The background image plays a central role in conveying this intent. Its brown-toned hue contributes to an archival atmosphere, reinforcing the documentary and historical dimension of the project. Within the image, symbolic elements are carefully balanced: children representing the future stand holding flags on one side, while troops advancing toward war appear on the other. This visual juxtaposition captures the tension between continuity and resistance, loss and persistence, that underpins the entire project. 
          </p> 
          
          <p>
            A central content box is positioned at the heart of the page to immediately attract attention while still allowing the background imagery to remain visible and meaningful. This box contains introductory text that outlines the project’s goals and contextual framework, acting as a threshold to the informational structure explored in subsequent pages. 
          </p> 
        
          <p>
            The title adopts the colors of the Palestinian flag, a visual strategy consistently maintained throughout the project to reinforce thematic coherence and national identity. 
          </p> 
          
          <h4>4.1.1 Navigation System </h4> 
          
          <p> 
            The navigation bar follows the same chromatic logic as the rest of the interface, drawing from the colors of the Palestinian flag. Beyond its aesthetic role, the navigation system is designed as a key accessibility and orientation tool. 
          </p> 
          
          <p>
            Its structure remains consistent across all pages and themes, allowing users to develop familiarity and navigate efficiently between different sections of the project. This stability reduces cognitive load and ensures that users can focus on content rather than interface learning.
          </p> 
        
          <p> 
            By maintaining a persistent and coherent navigation framework, the main page establishes structural continuity with the object pages and other sections of the project, reinforcing the idea of a unified system rather than a collection of isolated components. 
          </p> 

        <h3>4.2. The Map</h3>
        <p> </p>

        <h3>4.3 Objects</h3>
          <p>
            This section outlines the conceptual, structural, and visual strategies adopted for the presentation of objects within the project.
            I decided on the design of the object pages by the need to address a diverse audience while maintaining clarity, accessibility, and
            narrative depth. Objects are not presented as static entities, but as entry points into multiple interpretative layers that users can
            actively choose and explore.
          </p>
          
          <h4>4.3.1 Layout and Information Hierarchy</h4>
          <p>
            Each object is displayed individually to ensure focused engagement and ease of navigation. The layout combines a primary image with a
            concise set of metadata positioned alongside it.
          </p>
          <p>
            The metadata was intentionally selected to communicate the most essential and universally relevant information about each object. This
            information layer functions as a shared baseline for all users, regardless of age, background, or level of expertise.
          </p>
          <p>
            More detailed and specialized content is deliberately excluded from this initial layer and instead delegated to audience-specific
            narratives, allowing users to decide whether and how deeply to engage with the object.
          </p>
          
          <h4>4.3.2 Audience-Based Narrative System</h4>
          <p>
            To accommodate different reading needs and levels of interest, each object includes an accordion-based narrative system positioned
            beneath the main presentation.
          </p>
          <p>
            This system enables the coexistence of multiple narratives for the same object, allowing users to actively select content according to
            their interests, level of expertise, or curiosity. By supporting free exploration and the possibility to compare different
            interpretative approaches, the object presentation deliberately avoids a single linear narrative. Instead, it adopts a non-hierarchical
            and user-centered model of interpretation that respects individual engagement preferences and reading strategies.
          </p>
          <p>
            Each narrative is paired with a dedicated CSS theme that is activated upon selection. This ensures coherence between textual content and
            visual design, reinforcing the intended tone and target audience of each narrative.
          </p>
          <p>
            All themes are derived from a shared color palette inspired by the Palestinian flag, preserving visual and contextual unity across the
            project.
          </p>
          
          <h4>4.3.3 Theme for Young Visitors</h4>
          <p>
            The theme designed for younger audiences emphasizes engagement, simplicity, and sustained attention.
          </p>
          
          <p>Design choices include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              An animated background featuring moving olives, chosen for:
              <ul>
                <li>Their cultural symbolism</li>
                <li>Their effectiveness in attracting attention through motion</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>A light green stage to preserve text visibility despite background animation</li>
            <li>
              A very light diagonal pattern behind the text area to:
              <ul>
                <li>Create visual interest</li>
                <li>Avoid interference with readability</li>
              </ul>
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            The narrative content is intentionally brief and written in simple language. It focuses on concepts of resilience and steadfastness while
            avoiding complex or distressing historical details, ensuring that the material remains appropriate and comprehensible for younger users.
          </p>
          
          <h4>4.3.4 Theme for Adult Audiences</h4>
          <p>
            The adult-oriented theme adopts a more restrained and neutral visual language, prioritizing readability and accessibility.
          </p>
          
          <p>Key characteristics include:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>
              A palette dominated by black, white, and grey, with red accents derived from the national flag
            </li>
            <li>
              Slightly enlarged typography to accommodate users with visual impairments
            </li>
            <li>
              The integration of the keffiyeh pattern to reinforce cultural familiarity and thematic coherence
            </li>
          </ul>
          
          <p>
            To support usability and navigation, elements requiring user attention such as images and metadata blocks are emphasized through red
            borders. Interactive elements are further highlighted upon selection, providing clear visual navigation and improving accessibility for
            users less accustomed to digital interfaces.
          </p>


        <h3>4.4. The Narrations</h3>
          <p>
              The section I curated, <a href="narratives.html"> narration</a>, constitutes the core of the collection, not only as a functional way to display content but as a tool 
              to guide users through a predefined, coherent path. Moreover, the entire section is based on a dual-style 
              system: <strong> the Immersive Style </strong> and the <strong>Minimal Style</strong>. 
              The user can easily switch between these two modes, enabling distinct experiences on the same content.
          </p>

          <ul>
              <li><strong>Immersive Style:</strong> Designed for emotional engagement and dramatic visual storytelling.</li>
              <li><strong>Minimal Style:</strong> Optimized for readability, neutrality, and rapid information retrieval.</li>
          </ul>

          <p>
              This dual approach, apart from being a specific project requirement, perfectly aligns with Ghanfili’s 
              idea of open free exploration: «where users have the freedom to explore content at their own pace and 
              direction.This empowers users to delve deeper into the narrative, enhancing engagement 
              and allowing for a more personalized experience.» 
              <a class="source" href="documentation.html#source_13"> <small> [13] </small> </a> 
          </p>

          <p>
              From a technical perspective, all measurements were chosen using scalable units (vw, vh, and percentages) 
              to ensure adaptability across different screens. However, even though a basic media query 
              (<code>max-width: 600px</code>) ensures mobile phone usability, the primary format is mainly intended 
              for larger screens.
          </p>

          <h4 id="immersive-style">4.4.1. Immersive Style </h4>
          <p>
              The immersive theme was directly inspired by the concept of <strong>scrollytelling</strong>, observed in 
              websites like <a href="https://story.internal-displacement.org/the-road-was-long-a-voice-from-ukraine/index.html">
              The road was long: a voice from Ukraine</a> and <a href="https://www.nbcnews.com/specials/detroit-segregation-wall/"> 
              Detroit segregation wall still stands</a>, whose themes align with our politically-motivated exhibition. 
              These references and an understanding of scrollytelling literature guided the design choices.
          </p>

          <h5>Colors and Typography</h5>
              <p>
                  The palette—black background with white and red (<code>#c8102e</code>) text—mirrors three of the 
                  four colours of the Palestinian flag and exploits high-contrast readability.
                  It enhances atmospheric immersion by reducing peripheral visual noise.The use of <em> Georgia</em>, a 
                  serif typeface, reinforces the dramatic tone and supports a cinematic aesthetic.
              </p>

          <h5>Structure</h5>
              <p> 
                  The image height is set at <code>100vh</code> (<code>height: calc(100vh - 60px);</code>) so 
                  that the image occupies the whole screen, creating visual continuity and making the user feel 
                  “inside” the narrative frame (supporting emotional engagement).
              </p>
              <p>
                  The images are the centre of the focus; hence, the content, especially in the Timeline part, 
                  is kept minimal. The user can activate the content layer via a <code>:hover</code> action, revealing a button 
                  “more information” linked to the object’s page.
              </p>

          <h5>Animations and Thematic Cues</h5>
          <p>
            «Scrollytelling provides a form of presentation that keeps users engaged and encourages reading and 
            interaction through a continuous flow.»
            <a class="source" href="documentation.html#source_14"> <small> [14] </small> </a> 
          </p>

          <p>
              I included fade-in animation triggered on scroll with the intention to: 
          </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>Giving a specific rhythm into the narrative </li>
                  <li>Guiding the user’s eye from one element to another </li>
                  <li>Simulate the temporal unfolding of events</li>
              </ul>
          <p> As also declared by Ghanfili: «because scrollytelling takes users step-by-step 
              through a story, data can be presented progressively, making complex concepts easier to 
              understand without overwhelming users with too much information at once.»
              <a class="source" href="documentation.html#source_15"> <small> [15] </small> </a> 
          </p>

          <p>
              Sepia Effect (on <code> :hover</code>): Serves two specific functions:
          </p>
          <ul>
              <ol>
                  <li>Accessibility cue: To signal the interactivity of the image.</li>
                  <li>Thematical Sense of historicity: It subconsciously reminds the user of old photos, contributing to a sense of dramatic weight.</li>
              </ol>
          </ul>

          <strong>User Service</strong>
          <ul>
              <li><strong>Teacher (Alice):</strong> Can be used as a standalone presentation for the topic, having also explicit academic references.</li>
              <li><strong>General Visitor (Bruno):</strong> Can experience a sort of "virtual museum room", with a guided narrative connecting the items.</li>
              <li><strong>Expert (Carla):</strong> Could benefit from the cited sources to learn about specific literature on themes and could see the contextualized items.</li>
          </ul>


          <h4 id="minimal-style">4.4.2 Minimal Style </h4>

          <p>
              The minimal style relies on <strong>Style</strong> principles (grid rationality, typographic hierarchy, functional asymmetry) 
              and the Flat Design visual economy. The aim is to offer a consultation-based reading mode, enabling 
              users to scan the content at a glance, useful for audiences who need a clear, archival-like presentation of 
              the material.
          </p>
          <p>
              Inspiration was drawn from platforms like <a href="https://antenati.cultura.gov.it/story_author/john-tomassi/"> John Tomassi Archivi - Portale Antenati</a> and the
              <a href="https://www.911memorial.org/learn/students-and-teachers/DLE-archives"> National September Memorial & Museum.</a>
          </p>

          <h5>Colors and Typography</h5>
          <p>
              The background is a light grey, reinforcing the documentary-archival 
              tone. The main accent colour is green (<code>#017609</code>), the fourth colour of the country’s flag.
          </p>
          <p>
              The font is Arial(San-serif), following the neutral style and aligning with the team's coherent visual choices.
          </p>

          <h5>Structure and Scannability</h5>
          <p>
              The layout uses a grid (<code>display: grid</code>) and consistent asymmetrical spacing 
              (e.g., margins of <code>10vw</code> on desktop) to reflect the main layout rules of the Swiss style.
              This structure complies with the F-shaped reading pattern typical of online scanning, accelerating 
              navigation and making it easier to consult the whole collection with a quick skimming.
          </p> 
          <p>
              Images are generally smaller (<code>height: 20vh</code>) than the Immersive ones, as the focus is mainly on the text and not on the immersive nature of the items.
          </p>

          <p> 
              The Timeline in the minimal version is designed as a horizontal scroller
              (using Flexbox and <code>overflow-x: auto</code>), which is conventionally associated with temporal 
              progression.
          </p>        

          <p>
