            This page is your entry point to our collection. 
            You can choose to consult the items based on their <a href="timeline.html">historical timeline</a> or through a 
            more <a href="story.html">storytelling-based narration </a> designed to illuminate the pivotal role 
            of art and archive practices as acts of resistence against genocide.

        <p class="narration_p"> 
            To support and maximise your experience, we offer two distinct viewing modes that you can comfortably change 
            through the switch button in the top-left part of the screen. You can choose between:
            <ul>
                <li> Immersive mode: for a truly immersive and emotional theme layout </li>
                <li> Minimal mode: a clean and minimalist  alternative, focused more on item consultation.</li>
            </ul> 
            We hope you'll enjoy your visit.
