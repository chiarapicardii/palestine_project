        <h3 class="is_hidden"> The main practice of genocide is the complete destruction of bodies
            and memories so that there is no record in history of their existence </h3>
        <div id="erasure_intro" class="is_hidden"> 
            <p> «Imagine that you wake up one day and your entire human environment is gone.» This is how Sami 
                Abu Shehadeh tries to explain the Nakba 
                <a class="source" href="documentation.html#source_2"> <small> [2] </small> </a>, 
                an Arab word meaning “disaster”, “catastrophe” and referring to the displacement of the Palestinian people
                 in the period before, after and the foundation of Israel’s State, the <strong> 14th of may 1948 </strong>.</p>   
            <p> Historical and archaeological research documents an extensive process of destruction of the Palestinian 
                settlement fabric, like attested by All That Remains (Institute for Palestine Studies) 
                <a class="source" href="documentation.html#source_3"> <small> [3] </small> </a>, 
                <strong> 418 </strong> Palestinian villages depopulated or demolished in 1948. For most of them, only ruins, 
                isolated architectural traces, or no material evidence remain today. 
            </p>
            <p> However, the Zionist project is bigger and is not limited to the physical elimination. 
                Their aim is to eradicate completely all memory and presence of Palestinian presence in culture
                and history. In the 2024 LAP analysis of Gaza's heritage it was recorded: over 100 archaeological sites and approximately
                256 historical and cultural buildings have been destroyed or severely damaged, along with museums, 
                libraries, archives, and collections that housed genealogical documents, manuscripts, photographs, 
                and irreplaceable materials.
                <a class="source" href="documentation.html#source_4"> <small> [4] </small> </a> 
            </p>
            <p> The destruction of the material traces of the Palestinian people on their lands is a continuation 
                of their physical elimination as an indigenous population from that land. 
                <a class="source" href="documentation.html#source_5"> <small> [5] </small> </a> 
                Deleting their physical presence, their home, their villages and silencing their voice is the 
                only effective method Israel has to rewrite completely history, without any contradiction, 
                managing to present themselves as rightful in the eyes of most of the outside world. 
            </p>
            <p> Now, one of the most difficult challenges faced by Palestinians is trying to reclaim their 
                “permission to narrate” (Edward Said): 
                <a class="source" href="documentation.html#source_6"> <small> [6] </small> </a> 
                as they were repeatedly forced out their house Wester media presented distorted accounts 
                that largely ignored Zionist violence against civilian populations and instead resorted to 
                deploying Orientalist tropes about aggressive Arab militias and unreasonable demands by 
                Palestinians. 
                <a class="source" href="documentation.html#source_7"> <small> [7] </small> </a> 
            </p>
            <p> 
                We call call this a <strong> memoricide </strong> — the simultaneous destruction of human life and the 
                deliberate erasure of a people’s collective memory through the systematic targeting of cultural,
                historical, and religious landmarks, as well as the transformation of rural and urban landscapes — has
                become a deeply concerning aspect of the ongoing war on Gaza. 
                <a class="source" href="documentation.html#source_8"> <small> [8] </small> </a> 
            </p>
            <p> 
                Contemporary reports confirm that the threat persists: according to the UN Human Rights Council’s 
                Independent Inquiry, a genocide is ongoing in Gaza, targeting both human life and cultural heritage.

        <h3 class="is_hidden"> Practices of art and archival are weapons against genocide</h3>
            <div class="is_hidden" id="resistance_intro">
                <p> If, as we have shown, the destruction of buildings, streets, museums, schools,  
                    is aimed not only at eliminating the bodies but at erasing the cultural and historical heritage
                    of Palestine, then resistance cannot rely on just physical survival. It needs to work through 
                    the continuous reaffirmation of presence, of history, of memory, essentialy of existence. 
                </p>
                <p> 
                    This is the reason why the <strong> ṣumūd</strong> is so central: a cultural and ethical foundation
                    of Palestine life, often translated as “steadfastness”, but whose meaning is way more complex. 
                    As described by the <em> Interactive encyclopedia of the Palestine question </em> 
                    <a class="source" href="documentation.html#source_10"> <small> [10] </small> </a>
                    it is describing a way of life, where the body itself represents an object of resistance «present-day practices 
                    of sumud range from what are perceived as normal everyday activities like going to school, building
                    a house, keeping culture and memory alive, and cultivating the land to activities that have more
                    distinct political expressions, such as going to demonstrations, writing graffiti on the separation
                    wall, or exercising noncompliance with authorities.» <a class="source" href="documentation.html#source_11"> <small> [11]</small></a>
                </p>
                <p> Our collection aims to highlight precisely these forms of resistance. Through artworks, posters, photographs
                    of daily life, testimonies, poems, and archival fragments, we seek not only to represent steadfastness but
                    also to perform it. This digital collection is itself an act of wujūd 
                    <a class="source" href="documentation.html#source_12"> <small> [12] </small> </a>
                    — an assertion of presence that echoes
                    what Palestinian scholars describe as the “continuous possibility of continuity” that resists erasure.
                </p>
                <p>
                    By occupying digital space, by preserving and circulating what is continually threatened with disappearance,
                    every image, object, and text gathered here participates in resisting the ongoing erasure and in sustaining
                    the continuity of a people who refuse to disappear.
