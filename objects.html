          young_visitor: "In this drawing, a Palestinian freedom fighter stops a man wearing a hat that says “UN.” The man offers food and help marked “UNRWA,” but the fighter says: “Our cause is the liberation of our homeland and the return of our people.” That means: “We want to go home, not only get aid.” This poster was made a long time ago, when many Palestinians lived in refugee camps after losing their homes. The fighter’s clothes and strong voice show pride and hope. The picture teaches that people want justice and freedom, not only charity.",
          adult_visitor: "“Our Cause” (قضيتنا) is a political poster that appeared during the 1970s, distributed by the Palestine Liberation Organization’s Information Office. In the image, a Palestinian fighter halts a UN official offering aid marked “UNRWA.” The Arabic text in the speech bubble reads: “Our cause is the liberation of our homeland and the return of our people” [1]. The scene visualizes a critique of international aid agencies, especially UNRWA, suggesting that relief efforts risked replacing the demand for justice and return with dependency and charity. The poster expresses the PLO’s message of that era: the issue of Palestine was not a “refugee problem” but a national liberation movement[2].",
          graduate_student: "The poster “Our Cause” (قضيتنا) belongs to the political graphics tradition that emerged from the PLO’s visual campaigns of the 1970s. Produced under the PLO’s Unified Information Office, it presents a clear ideological argument: the Palestinian struggle must be understood as a fight for national liberation, not a humanitarian crisis [3]. In the image, a fedayee,a symbol of resistance and masculine steadfastness (sumud), blocks a United Nations delegate offering UNRWA aid. The text in the speech bubble, “Our cause is the liberation of our homeland and the return of our people,” reframes the Palestinian question as one of decolonization rather than relief [1]. By depicting the UN official as well-meaning but misguided, the poster articulates a critique of international bureaucracies that depoliticize Palestinian suffering. UNRWA’s refugee camps, food rations, and identification cards are visually juxtaposed with the fedayee’s rifle, uniform, and refusal gesture, marking the contrast between dependency and self-determination [2]. Such posters circulated widely in camps, universities, and PLO offices, and functioned as instruments of popular education and mobilization [3]. They helped consolidate a collective identity grounded in resistance, rejecting the reduction of Palestinian peoplehood to a humanitarian file [4].",
          field_expert: "The poster “Our Cause” (قضيتنا) exemplifies the rhetorical and semiotic strategies of PLO-era propaganda art, where graphic design served as an instrument of ideological education. Emerging from the late 1970s context of the UN General Assembly’s annual “Question of Palestine” sessions, the image encodes the tension between international humanitarianism and anti-colonial liberation discourse [2]. Formally, the composition is didactic: the armed fedayee—rendered in camouflage, kaffiyeh, and resolute posture—occupies the visual and moral high ground, while the UN official, caricatured in Western attire, proffers aid packages labeled “UNRWA.” The spatial arrangement visually situates the United Nations as external to the Palestinian space of struggle [3,4]. Textually, the Arabic phrase “قضيتنا تحرير وطني وعودة و تقرير مصير” (“Our cause is national liberation, return, and self-determination”) summarizes the PLO’s programmatic triad. In this sense, the poster translates political doctrine into visual pedagogy [3]. The work’s anti-humanitarian critique anticipates scholarly debates on the depoliticization of Palestinian identity through relief structures. As Anne Irfan notes, UNRWA’s operations produced “an institutionalized refugeehood” that the PLO sought to transcend by reasserting political agency [2]. The poster thus participates in a discursive struggle over representation: whether Palestinians are global subjects of charity or revolutionary agents of liberation [4]."

          young_visitor: "This magazine, called Al-Miqla', was made by Palestinian women more than thirty years ago. It talks about their work, their families, and their dreams for freedom. Inside are drawings, poems, and news about how women helped others during the First Intifada — a time when people protested for their rights. It reminds us that even in hard times, learning, art, and kindness can keep people together.",
          adult_visitor: "This 1988 issue of Al-Miqla' was produced by the Movement of Democratic Women in Israel. It served as a platform for Palestinian women to express their views on politics, education, and community work during the early Intifada. The magazine highlighted solidarity between women across regions, addressed gender roles in national struggle, and documented artistic and social life under occupation. It offers a glimpse into how print culture connected activism and everyday life.",
          graduate_student: "The March 1988 issue of Al-Miqla' represents a crucial moment in the intersection of Palestinian feminist and national discourses. Published by the Movement of Democratic Women in Israel, it articulates a dual struggle: women’s emancipation and collective national liberation. Within its pages, contributors such as Naji al-Ali and Mohammad Ali Taha discuss education, labor, and resistance through literary and journalistic forms. The issue also commemorates International Women’s Day, situating local struggles within global feminist narratives. Al-Miqla' thus serves as a primary source for studying how grassroots women’s organizations mediated between political activism and cultural production during the First Intifada. Its multilingual readership (Arabic and occasionally Hebrew) reflects the magazine’s bridging role across communities.",
          field_expert: "Al-Miqla', issued in March 1988 by the Movement of Democratic Women in Israel, exemplifies the material culture of Palestinian feminist periodicals during the late twentieth century. Emerging at the height of the First Intifada, the magazine performs a discursive function that intertwines political resistance with gender consciousness. From a historiographical standpoint, it extends the legacy of earlier Arab women’s journals such as al-Mar’a al-Jadīda while embedding itself in a distinctly Palestinian context of occupation, displacement, and solidarity. The inclusion of figures like Naji al-Ali signals an awareness of visual satire as political critique. Researchers may read Al-Miqla' as a textual artifact revealing the editorial strategies of women’s movements negotiating state censorship and social conservatism. Its digitization within the Walid Fahoum Collection underscores the epistemic importance of archival recovery for contemporary postcolonial scholarship."

          young_visitor: "Look at this artwork. The man leans forward, heavy-loaded, carrying a city-scape on his back. It’s called “Camel of Heavy Burdens” but it’s a human figure, not a camel. He carries his homeland on his shoulders. For you, this means: sometimes people bear big weights — memories, hopes, places they love. Even if it’s hard, they keep going.",
          adult_visitor: "Sliman Mansour’s “Camel of Heavy Burdens – First Printing” draws on the image of a porter carrying a city, symbolizing the enduring weight of homeland, displacement and the refusal to let go. Originally painted in 1973 and reproduced as a poster shortly after, the piece became an icon of Palestinian visual culture.",
          graduate_student: "The poster version of Mansour’s “Camel of Heavy Burdens” is a seminal object within Palestinian visual culture and the broader history of graphic arts in conditions of displacement. The original painting (1973) and its first poster printing (circa 1975) depict an elderly porter—barefoot, bent, yet steady—carrying what appears to be the city-scape of Jerusalem (including the Dome as the symbol of the town) on his back, his rope-based load tied to his forehead. Through its iconography, the work engages with the idea of sumud (steadfastness) — staying rooted even amid exile. The poster’s circulation in the late 1970s and 1980s in Palestinian territories and diaspora makes it also a document of public expression: it moved off gallery walls into homes, walls, prints, thereby entering everyday visual life. The image invites multi-layered enquiry: how does the figure of the porter function as a metaphor for Palestinian identity? What does the burden represent (land, memory, diaspora)? From a material culture standpoint: how did the poster’s printing, distribution and location shape its meaning? From a curatorial perspective: the transition from painted canvas to poster to archive highlights the challenges of preserving visual culture under colonial/occupation conditions and in diasporic contexts.",
          field_expert: "Sliman Mansour’s “Camel of Heavy Burdens – First Printing” occupies a crucial position in the nexus of Palestinian art, visual memory, and resistance aesthetics. The work can be read as a manifesto of sumud — the notion of steadfastness — materialized in the body of the porter, whose stooped posture yet unwavering gaze signals perseverance in the face of dispossession. As Dina Ramadan has analyzed, the painting and its subsequent poster iterations map onto Palestine’s evolving historical geography: the post-1967 occupation, the intensification of refugee experiences and the emergence of a visual lexicon of resistance. From a curatorial-theoretical perspective, the object’s journey from painting (1973) to mass-circulated poster (1975) to digital archive invites critical reflection: how does the shift in medium affect meaning? The porter’s burden becomes not only his own but symbolic of a collective load. Moreover, the poster’s display contexts (homes, camps, public walls, diaspora centres) render visible the material and cultural strategies of Palestinian refusal and remembering. The incomplete metadata of the piece (exact print run, publisher details) also foregrounds the epistemic gaps in documenting art born of conflict zones and encampment contexts. As such, the piece serves both as an artwork and as a case-study in the challenges of museological and archival practice."

          young_visitor: "Many years ago, a war started in Palestine. A lot of people had to run away from their homes because of this. This poem, called 'War and Peace', was written by a woman named Fatima al-Muhib. In the poem, she talks about how scary the war was – with loud bombs and gunshots – and how families like hers had to leave their towns. She also writes about hoping for peace. She dreams that one day all the people who had to leave can go back home to Palestine and live there safely. The poem shows that war is very bad, and that living in peace together is much better than fighting. It’s an important poem because it helps us not to forget about what is happening to them.",
          adult_visitor: "'War and Peace' is a short handwritten poem by Palestinian artist Fatima al-Muhib that reflects on the turmoil of 1948, the starting year of war and displacement in Palestinepalarchive.org. In simple rhyming lines, al-Muhib describes the chaos of conflict – “bombs and gunshots” falling like rain – and the fear that forced her family and many others to flee their homes. This 1948 upheaval, known as the Nakba (Arabic for “catastrophe”), saw an estimated 750,000 Palestinians expelled or compelled to flee from their towns and villagesaljazeera.com. Al-Muhib’s poem captures personal memories of that flight: she recalls running from Jericho and taking shelter in a small cottage amid the fighting. Despite the suffering, the tone of the poem is hopeful. Fatima expresses a heartfelt wish for peace in Palestine and for all the refugees to return to their landpalarchive.org. As a piece of creative testimony, this poem helps general visitors understand the human impact of the 1948 events and the enduring Palestinian longing for home and peace.",
          graduate_student: "Written in the aftermath of the 1948 Nakba, Fatima al-Muhib’s 'War and Peace' serves as a compelling primary document of Palestinian collective memory and resistance. The Nakba – literally “catastrophe” – refers to the mass displacement of Palestinians during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, when roughly three-quarters of the Palestinian population (around 750,000 people) were violently uprooted from their homesaljazeera.com. Al-Muhib’s poem provides a firsthand account of that turmoil: it recounts fleeing from Jericho amid “bombs and gunshots” falling like showers, conveying the fear and chaos of war. Her narrative aligns with many contemporary eyewitness accounts and creative expressions from that period. Notably, in the immediate years after 1948, Palestinian writers and artists, often working in exile or under occupation, began to record their experiences and aspirations in literature and art. This cultural work was crucial in preserving the memory of what had happened and in cultivating a will to persevere and return despite the dispersionpalquest.org. Al-Muhib’s verse—though simple in language—encapsulates core themes of Palestinian exile literature: the trauma of displacement, the sin and senseless destruction of war, and an unyielding hope for peace and return to the homeland. Importantly, 'War and Peace' functions as more than personal reflection; it is an act of resistance through memory. By writing about her ordeal and her hopes, the author contributes to what scholars describe as the narration of memory as a form of community-building among displaced Palestinians. Literature of the Nakba era often created a shared sense of identity and purpose through storytelling, ensuring that the Palestinian catastrophe would not be forgotten. Indeed, such poems and songs kept alive the dream of return – for example, the famous lines “One Day, We Will Return” from poet Harun Hashim Rashid, which became an anthem of exilepalquest.org. Al-Muhib’s poem belongs to this body of work that affirmed the Palestinians’ right to live in peace in their own state and refusal to accept permanent loss of their homelandpalarchive.org. Preserved in the Omar al-Jallad Collection of the Palestinian Museum Digital Archive, the poem provides direct insight into the emotional and political landscape of Palestinians in the mid-20th century. It is a poignant example of how personal art and writing helped sustain national memory, identity, and resistance in the face of dispossession.",
          field_expert:"A digitized page from Fatima al-Muhib’s handwritten poem 'War and Peace', preserved in the Omar al-Jallad Collection. The poem’s simple rhyming couplets belie its profound historical and cultural significance. From a scholarly perspective, Fatima al-Muhib’s “War and Peace” is a rich artifact encapsulating the interplay of personal narrative and national history in Palestinian cultural memory. Composed in English by a Palestinian artist who directly witnessed the events of the late 1940s, the poem narrates the experience of the Nakba – the 1948 catastrophe that saw the destruction of Palestinian society and the creation of a massive refugee population. In just a few lines, al-Muhib describes the violence (“bombs and gunshots” likened to torrential rain) and the ensuing exodus (“from Jericho we ran away with refugees who found their way”), documenting the forced displacement of her community. This account corresponds to what we know from historical records: between 1947 and 1949, around 750,000 Palestinians (out of 1.9 million) were expelled or fled from their towns and villages amid the war, transforming them into refugees scattered across the regionaljazeera.com. Al-Muhib’s reference to seeking shelter in “a small cottage” during the fighting evokes the improvised and precarious refuge that many found. Her portrayal of war as “damage” and “great sin” reflects a moral repudiation of the violence that aligns with contemporary Palestinian literary responses to the Nakba. As early as 1949, poets like Fadwa Tuqan were already writing elegies and laments for the lost Palestine (“A Portrait of the Nakba”), and by the early 1950s, others such as Abu Salma (Abd al-Karim al-Karmi), Harun Hashim Rashid, and Muin Bseiso produced poems that not only mourned the homeland but also rejected the imposed reality and called for resistancepalquest.org. Al-Muhib’s work echoes this spirit, especially in its latter half where the tone shifts from describing war to envisioning peace and restoration. Critically, “War and Peace” articulates a hope that is both political and deeply personal: “All nations for the peace must sign / To our state in Palestine. To live in peace is our right. It is much better than to fight.” In these lines, the author encapsulates the Palestinian yearning for international recognition of their rights (a peace that the nations of the world endorse) and the fundamental principle of the Right of Return. Indeed, the poem anticipates the very demand that has remained central to Palestinian discourse for decades: that refugees have the right to return to the homes and lands from which they were expelledaljazeera.com. Al-Muhib’s insistence on the justice of living in peace in Palestine dovetails with the language of U.N. General Assembly Resolution 194 (1948), which affirmed refugees’ right to return and restitution. The poem thereby serves as a grassroots voice of resistance, reinforcing through art what was being stated in diplomatic arenas – that the displacement was not accepted as final, and that return was inalienable. Furthermore, the context of the poem’s preservation adds another layer of significance. It survives as part of the Omar al-Jallad Collection, essentially a family archive that includes Fatima al-Muhib’s writings and artworkspalarchive.org. This indicates the role of personal and familial efforts in safeguarding Palestinian heritage. Al-Muhib, born in Jericho in 1927 (and later one of the first Palestinian women to receive formal art education abroad), used both visual art and poetry to document her reality. Her decision to write this poem in English is notable; it may have been aimed at reaching an international audience or simply reflecting her educational background, but it also situates the poem within a cosmopolitan tradition of anti-war literature. The simplicity of its diction and rhyme suggests it may have been intended to be easily understood and perhaps even recited or taught, possibly to children or youth, as part of passing down the memory of 1948. In a broader cultural analysis, works like “War and Peace” exemplify how cultural production functioned as a form of sumud (steadfastness). When Palestinians are facing not only physical expulsion but also an attempt to erase their history and identity, each story, poem, or painting that records their perspective is an act of preserving truth and asserting identitypalquest.org. As one scholarly highlight notes, post-Nakba cultural activity was essential in protecting the past from being “plundered or erased” by colonial narrativespalquest.org. Al-Muhib’s poem, therefore, is not an isolated cry but part of a larger tapestry of memory work – a “primary expression of memory and resistance”. It concretizes the notion that remembrance itself is resistance: by remembering and writing about the Nakba and its aftermath, Palestinians like al-Muhib resisted the obliteration of their history and asserted their continued presence and rights. Its preservation allows us to witness how a single handwritten page can echo the collective voice of a people determined to remember their past and reclaim their future. As one contemporary commentator observed, the very essence of Palestinian resilience and resistance is rooted in the experience of dispossessionthemarkaz.org. Al-Muhib’s “War and Peace” is a poignant embodiment of that principle – using the power of the pen to uphold memory against forgetting, and to transform the pain of loss into hope for peace and homecoming."

          young_visitor: "This is a poster about Land Day, a very special day for Palestinians every year on March 30th. On Land Day, people remember that their land is important to them. A long time ago, in 1976, many Palestinian farmers in the Galilee region were upset because some leaders wanted to take away their farms and olive groves. The farmers and their families held a big peaceful protest to say, “This land is ours!” Unfortunately, some of the people who stood up for the land were hurt – six brave protesters were killed during those marchesaljazeera.com. Now every year on Land Day, Palestinians plant olive trees and hold ceremonies to remember these farmers and show they love their landaljazeera.comfalastin.me.",

The olive tree in particular has deep meaning: it is a long-lived, fruit-bearing tree that symbolizes Palestinian heritage, peace, and rootedness in the homelandfalastin.me. This 1983 poster – issued by the PLO’s Information Office – was designed by artist Ismail Shammout to honor Land Daypalmuseum.org. It is based on an 1875 lithograph by British artist David Roberts. The image shows a view of Nazareth (northern Palestine) with traditional stone houses on a hillside, surrounded by olive trees and prickly pear cactuspalarchive.org. Shammout recontextualized this 19th-century “Holy Land” scene by labeling it “Nazareth – Palestine – 1875,” thus reclaiming the landscape for Palestinian history and identity. By using an Orientalist-era image, Shammout’s poster makes a visual claim: it links contemporary Land Day struggles to a long Palestinian presence in the land. In this way the art reinforces national identity and memory.",
          graduate_student: "Land Day (Yom al-Ard) is a cornerstone of modern Palestinian history and visual culture. On March 30, 1976, Palestinian citizens of Israel organized a general strike and mass marches across the Galilee in response to a government order to expropriate roughly 20,000 dunams of Arab-owned land between the villages of Sakhnin and Arrabaen.wikipedia.org. Israeli forces opened fire on the unarmed demonstrators, killing six Palestinians and wounding over a hundreden.wikipedia.orgaljazeera.com. This was the first widespread Palestinian national mobilization since 1948, and it entrenched March 30 as Land Day – an annual day of remembrance and protest for Palestinians both inside Israel and in the occupied territoriesen.wikipedia.orgalhaq.org. Ismail Shammout’s 1983 poster “30 March, The Day of the Land” was produced under the PLO’s Unified Information Office as part of a series commemorating this anniversarypalmuseum.org. Shammout (1930–2006) is a seminal Palestinian artist whose work consistently addressed exile, resistance and national identityzawyeh.net. He himself had lived through the 1948 Nakba and the Palestinian refugee experience, and his art often depicts the refugees’ memories and aspirationszawyeh.net. In this poster, Shammout adapts a David Roberts lithograph (printed 1875) of Nazareth – originally an Orientalist “view” of Ottoman Palestine – and reframes it as part of the Palestinian national narrativepalmuseum.orgpalarchive.org. The scene shows Nazareth’s traditional vernacular architecture: white stone houses with domed roofs or flat terraces, clustered on terraced hillsides. Surrounding the village are plentiful olive trees and a large stand of prickly-pear cactipalarchive.org. The olive tree is a potent symbol in Palestinian culture – archaeologically ancient and embedded in family life – representing deep roots and continuityfalastin.me. Poet Mahmoud Darwish famously wrote, “If the olive trees knew the hands that planted them, their oil would become tears,” capturing the tree’s link to memory and homelandfalastin.me. Cacti (sabr in Arabic) likewise symbolize resilience and patience in a harsh environment. By prominently depicting these plants, the poster explicitly ties the Land Day struggle to the land itself and to Palestinian rural heritage. Roberts’s original lithographs have been analyzed as artifacts of 19th-century Ottoman Palestinelink.springer.com – technically Orientalist images, but also recordings of the landscape and built environment of that era. Shammout’s reuse of Roberts’s image thus subverts its colonial origins: he re-inscribes the scene with a Palestinian title and adds the Land Day slogan. This act “appropriates” Orientalist visual material and reclaims it as national heritage. In doing so, the poster situates the 1976 protests within a historical continuum: it visually asserts that Palestinians were living in and cultivating Nazareth long before modern conflicts, thereby reinforcing the argument for enduring land rights. Politically, the poster ties together memory, resistance and identity. Land Day itself is a moment of collective memory, linking the victims of 1976 to a century of dispossession and resistance in Palestinealhaq.orgalhaq.org. By commemorating Land Day, the poster contributes to the politics of memory: it reminds Palestinians (and others) of a narrative of injustice and perseverance. The text and image work together to communicate that the people of Nazareth/Palestine have claimed and defended this land as their own. Through its art-historical and nationalist layers, the poster exemplifies how cultural production can cement a national identity rooted in specific places and histories.",
          field_expert: "“30 March – The Day of the Land” is a rich example of Palestinian visual-political discourse. Land Day (Yawm al-Arz) itself must be understood within the broader settler-colonial context of Israel’s creation and expansion. In March 1976, the Israeli government announced plans to expropriate tens of thousands of dunams in the Galilee, as part of a deliberate policy to “Judaize” the regionen.wikipedia.orgalhaq.org. The response – a general strike and mass rallies by Arab citizens of Israel – culminated in what historians call a pivotal moment of Palestinian nationalization within Israel. Six Arab protesters were killed by Israeli police in Nazareth and Sakhnin, and over a hundred woundedaljazeera.comalhaq.org. Scholars note that Land Day functions not only as an act of protest but as a form of counter-memory, connecting contemporary resistance to the “mass forcible displacement” of the 1948 Nakba (in which 85% of indigenous Palestinians were expelled) and to continuing expropriationsalhaq.orgen.wikipedia.org. Ismail Shammout’s poster engages this history at multiple levels. Visually, it repurposes a mid-19th-century lithograph by David Roberts, an image originally intended for a European audience fascinated by the “Holy Land”palmuseum.orglink.springer.com. By rebranding it “Nazareth – Palestine – 1875,” Shammout asserts a Palestinian cartography: Nazareth is emphatically identified as Palestinian territory in the Ottoman era. The poster’s aesthetic – toned parchment background, border framing, clear typeface – evokes a document of historical record. In graphic design terms, it simultaneously serves as a remembrance (like a historical photograph) and as political propaganda (being issued by the PLO’s Information Office). Critically, the iconography is loaded. The town’s white-washed buildings (with characteristic domes and cisterns) recall traditional Palestinian rural architecture, highlighting continuity from Ottoman times to the present. The surrounding olive groves are more than scenery: they explicitly signal a cultivated homeland. In Palestinian cultural memory, olive trees embody heritage and defiance against uprootingfalastin.me. Indeed, planting olive trees has become a ritual act on Land Day, symbolizing peace and return. As a UNESCO-affiliated observer notes, olive trees are “universal symbols of peace and Palestinian rootedness in their land”embraceme.org. Likewise, the cactus (sabra) has patriotic overtones: the Arabic sabr means patience or endurance, and Palestinians have long associated the hardy cactus fruit with native perseverance. Although not explicitly cited in the sources above, this motif figures in Palestinian art (see, e.g., “[Patience] as Resistance” in contemporary exhibits). Shammout himself was a self-conscious architect of Palestinian art-activism. A founding figure in Palestinian modernism, he explicitly stated that his work “never ceases depicting the Palestinian exodus” and that dispossession, dream of return, and “the dignity and pride” of his people formed “the soul of his art”zawyeh.net. In this poster, Shammout extends that mission: he layers the memory of 1948, 1967 and 1976 into one image. The caption (not shown in our sources but present on the poster) likely reads in both Arabic and English, bridging local and global audiences. By evoking 1875 Nazareth, the poster makes a discursive claim: despite modern expulsions and fragmentation, the Palestinian people remain “inseparable as a whole” across time and placealhaq.org. In the vocabulary of settler-colonial studies, Shammout’s artwork re-narrativizes space – reclaiming the visual archive of Palestine as our history. In sum, “30 March – The Day of the Land” integrates art, memory and politics. It stands as an example of how visual culture sustains national identity under occupation. As Al-Haq notes, Land Day’s legacy is that Palestinians continue to resist in hopes of “dominating the whole land of historic Palestine with the least [settler] population,” a “ruthless” colonial aimalhaq.org. The poster contests this aim by affirming that historical Palestine included cities like Nazareth with an active Arab presence. By connecting a 19th-century landscape to a 20th-century political event, Shammout’s design asserts that the struggle for land rights and the act of remembrance are themselves acts of identity formation. It reminds viewers that land, memory and resistance are inseparable in the Palestinian narrativealhaq.orgfalastin.me."

          young_visitor: "In the poster titled “Steadfastness”, we see a building with a golden dome, which many people around the world recognise as a symbol of a sacred place, placed inside a sombre room, with strong shadows and light streaming from a barred window. The word “steadfastness” means maintaining determination and refusing to be moved. The picture invites the viewer to think of the building (and what it stands for) as something that must be held onto, even in hard times. When your home, your culture or your beliefs are threatened, you can choose to stand firm rather than abandon them. It’s a visual message of hope and courage, not just sadness.",
          adult_visitor: "“Steadfastness” shows a building with the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem within a room whose walls and barred window create a sense of imprisonment or siege. The juxtaposition of sacred architecture and confinement evokes a message of determination: one must remain firm, maintain hope, and refuse to surrender one’s rights or heritage. In the broader context of Palestinian visual culture, such posters serve as expressions of resilience and identity. They remind the viewer that the struggle is not only external but also symbolic: keeping alive memory, place, and sovereignty even when circumstances are dark [2].",
          graduate_student: "The poster “Steadfastness” functions as a visual articulation of the Palestinian concept of sumūd (steadfastness) the ethos of enduring and persisting amid dispossession, occupation, and exile [1]. The representation of the golden‑dome shrine, the Al‑Aqsa Mosque/Temple Mount, within a barred chamber creates an allegory of containment: sacred space rendered captive, yet illuminated. From a semiotic perspective, the contrast between dark surrounding walls and the illuminated dome emphasises moral inversion: what appears physically confined (the shrine) becomes spiritually elevated. The barred window allows light, signifying hope and transcendence. This poster can be placed within the tradition of Palestinian poster art (1960s‑1980s) where graphic design was mobilised for political education, self‑assertion, and popular mobilisation [2]. As one commentary notes, Palestinian posters “provided a way to rebel, maintain hope, and sustain a collective identity” [2]. In museum or archival terms, the poster underscores how art becomes a site of memory and resistance. The viewer is compelled to reflect: who is being imprisoned — the space, the people, the idea? And what does it mean to remain steadfast when the walls are closing in? [3].",
          field_expert: "The poster “Steadfastness” is a paradigmatic example of how Palestinian graphic art deploys architectural iconography and spatial metaphor to convey political subjectivity [1]. The golden dome—likely referencing Jerusalem’s Islamic shrine—serves symbolically as locus of national and religious aspiration, while the surrounding environment (a confined, barred room) evokes themes of occupation, siege, and containment. In presenting a sacred structure within a carceral setting, the poster collapses the dichotomy between sanctuary and captivity, thereby articulating an aesthetics of sumūd, resistance not through overt conflict but through remaining rooted and refusing displacement. The barred window admits light, signalling not concession but defiant hope [2]. The poster also participates in a longer genealogy of PLO-era poster art (1960s‑80s), wherein mass‑reproduced graphics became pedagogical tools for articulating a narrative of liberation and return. As one analysis observes, posters of this genre “formed a testament to the resilience of a people … providing hope for liberation and peace” [2]. In terms of visual methodology, the composition’s chiaroscuro, spatial framing, and symbolic minimalism invite semiotic unpacking: the viewer is positioned both outside and inside; the sacred is framed as vulnerable yet luminous. This duality invites reflection on the political ontology of place under occupation. For archival and curatorial praxis, “Steadfastness” illustrates how ephemera of mass distribution (posters) acquire long‑term cultural value. They mediate between temporal events (conflict, exile) and enduring identities (home, memory) [3]."

The picture shows something important: even when life is difficult, people find joy in small, shared moments. Watermelon, a favorite summer fruit in Palestine, often means friendship, hospitality, and home. This image reminds us that ordinary life, laughter, and friendship are also part of history, not just war or sadness.",
          adult_visitor: "Taken in Jerusalem in 1964, this color photograph depicts three young men sitting at a small table, laughing and sharing watermelon. It comes from a private family collection preserved in the Palestinian Museum Digital Archive. The casual setting, plain walls, lace curtains, and a shared plate, suggests domestic intimacy. The image contrasts sharply with dominant representations of Palestinians as refugees or militants; instead, it affirms normal life, humor, and friendship. Watermelon has also become a cultural symbol: its red, green, white, and black colors recall the Palestinian flag, and its presence in art and protest later came to represent identity and resilience. This photo, however, predates that symbolism, it shows the fruit simply as part of ordinary life, a quiet testimony of joy amid history.",
          graduate_student: "This photograph, catalogued as “Hisham Halwani and Others,” belongs to the vernacular photographic tradition of mid-20th-century Palestine. Taken in Jerusalem in 1964, the picture shows three men in casual attire, seated around a table with several sliced watermelons. One smiles at the camera, another eats, and a third looks toward his friend. Their relaxed posture and laughter evoke a domestic setting rather than a studio portrait. From a historical perspective, this image exemplifies the private, human dimension of Palestinian modernity, capturing leisure and companionship in the post-Nakba decades. Unlike photojournalistic imagery centered on conflict or exile, such domestic photographs construct a counter-archive of everyday life. Thematically, the watermelon carries layered meanings. In later decades, particularly after the 1967 occupation, the fruit became a political emblem because its colors mirror those of the banned Palestinian flag. In this earlier context, however, its appearance is purely social, a seasonal ritual, tied to family gatherings and hospitality. This image thus functions as a site of visual resistance: it insists that Palestinian identity is not reducible to suffering, but also grounded in laughter, taste, and togetherness.",
          field_expert: "The photograph “Hisham Halwani and Others” invites interpretation at the intersection of vernacular photography, affective historiography, and visual resistance. Captured in 1964, the color snapshot depicts three men in a domestic setting, sharing watermelon at a modest table. The apparent spontaneity of the image, informal poses, casual clothing, unposed gazes, situates it within what Marianne Hirsch terms “postmemory’s family frames”: visual forms that transmit affective and cultural memory across generations. Archival context reveals the photo as part of a private collection rather than an institutional record. As such, it participates in the formation of a counter-archive of Palestinian everyday life. Against the dominant global visual economy that has long represented Palestinians through war, displacement, or humanitarian crisis, this photograph asserts an alternative temporality: one of leisure, friendship, and domestic joy. Symbolically, the watermelon operates on two registers. First, as a pre-political object, a fruit of summer, abundance, and sociability; second, retrospectively, as an unintentional prefiguration of later nationalist iconography. Following the 1967 occupation, the display of the Palestinian flag was outlawed, and artists began using the watermelon’s colors as surrogate national symbols. From a curatorial standpoint, its digitization within the Palestinian Museum Digital Archive exemplifies the institutional commitment to salvaging vernacular memory as part of decolonial museology. The photo, mundane yet profound, thus performs a dual function: it restores visibility to ordinary Palestinian lives and challenges the reduction of Palestinian subjectivity to trauma."

          adult_visitor: "Taken from the Yousef al-Qutob Collection and preserved in the Palestinian Museum Digital Archive, the image shows a child brandishing a slingshot during violent altercations on Al-Bireh Street, presumably with Israeli occupation forces. The photo was documented by al-Qutob, a journalist for WAFA. Such imagery reveals how Palestinian children are often drawn into confrontations, illustrating the lived reality of occupation and protest at the street level. It also raises awareness of how humanitarian organizations report on the psychological and social consequences of militarized environments on Palestinian youth.",
          graduate_student: "The photograph derives from the Yousef al-Qutob Collection. The image frames a boy aiming a slingshot, a symbol of asymmetrical resistance and improvisational protest, against an unseen adversary. The act evokes the ethics of representation and the intergenerational dimension of resistance. From a visual-semiotic standpoint, the slingshot symbolizes material scarcity and moral strength, marking the “David vs Goliath” dynamic that recurs across Palestinian protest imagery. Scholars have documented how military encounters expose children to systemic violence and trauma while shaping social identity. In the broader corpus of Palestinian visual culture, this photograph functions as both record and metaphor: the child’s gesture embodies sumud — steadfastness — while also inviting reflection on the ethics of photographing minors in conflict.",
          field_expert: "The photograph occupies a critical position within the visual archive of Palestinian resistance. Housed in the Yousef al-Qutob Collection, it exemplifies the convergence of documentary practice and political testimony. As an image, it articulates a politics of visibility: the Palestinian child not as passive victim but as embodied agent of dissent. The use of the slingshot, a recurrent icon in Palestinian resistance art, recodes vulnerability as defiance. From a representational theory perspective, the composition performs a visual reversal: the child’s body, poised and intentional, occupies the foreground; the militarized power remains unseen. This absence compels the viewer to confront asymmetry through imagination rather than spectacle. Contextually, the photograph aligns with intensified confrontations in the West Bank during the late 1980s and early 1990s. It serves not merely as reportage but as a locus of epistemic negotiation between innocence and militancy, documentation and advocacy, anchored in the lived realities of occupation."

It invites us to think about memory: why do we honour people who died in wars? It helps us remember that even when wars are in the past, their effects remain.",
          adult_visitor: "Taken by the American Colony (Jerusalem) photo department and catalogued in the Library of Congress, the image evidences the interweaving of colonial military rituals and local political tensions. The cemetery itself, established for Commonwealth war-dead, stands as a symbol of British Imperial sacrifice, while the date (Armistice Day) situates the event in the culture of remembrance. Understanding this photograph invites reflection on how memorial practices take place in contested terrains, and how such rituals may overlap with unrest.",
          graduate_student: "The photograph captures a moment of ceremonial commemoration set within a colonial landscape undergoing profound tension. The timing (November 11, 1936) coincides with Armistice Day, the British Empire’s annual ritual of remembrance for its First World War dead, and it occurs at the height of the Arab Revolt (1936–1939), the largest anti-colonial uprising in Mandate Palestine. The site, the Jerusalem War Cemetery on Mount Scopus, established by the Commonwealth War Graves Commission, was a spatial assertion of imperial permanence and sacred memory. The 1936 ceremony thus functioned not merely as remembrance but as imperial reaffirmation, projecting British legitimacy through ritual in a period of colonial fragility. The Matson Photo Service frequently juxtaposed the disciplined imagery of imperial authority with glimpses of local resistance or disorder. The military band procession can be read as a performative spectacle of discipline, meant to embody imperial control amid revolt. The photograph illustrates how visual archives acted as instruments of governance as much as documentation, the caption’s dual emphasis — “Palestine disturbances” and “Armistice Day” — encapsulating the simultaneity of mourning and domination.",
          field_expert: "The photograph stands at the intersection of imperial memory, colonial visuality, and insurgent modernity. The setting, Mount Scopus, symbolically charged, hosted both the CWGC cemetery and the Hebrew University. Within this layered geography, the Armistice Day ceremony enacted an imperial micro-topography of remembrance: a ritual of belonging by colonial officials in a space otherwise characterized by political estrangement. The Matson photographic enterprise participated in the disciplinary technology of the photograph, representing the British Mandate as simultaneously benevolent and embattled. The composition—disciplined ranks of soldiers exiting the cemetery—embodies the imperial optic of governance. Armistice Day ceremonies, transplanted from metropolitan Britain to colonial peripheries, enacted collective memory as an imperial performance. In Palestine, such rituals sought to inscribe British sovereignty within local temporalities. Within postcolonial theory, the image illustrates the colonial archive as a site of epistemic power, where captions codified resistance as disorder. The photograph’s dialectic between living performers and monumental dead metaphorically sustained imperial continuity. Its layered meanings extend beyond 1936, prefiguring later debates about commemoration and dispossession. It remains an exemplary case for studying how visual archives mediate ritual, violence, and power."

          graduate_student: "The poster stands as a key artefact of Palestinian cultural production in the late twentieth century, revealing how visual language was mobilized to express political identity under displacement. The central composition portrays a woman in a richly embroidered dress holding a stylized hand-shaped emblem inscribed with “Palestine” and “al-Quds.” This symbolic system fuses vernacular craft and political meaning: the embroidered garment functions as both map and archive, transforming textile patterns into a repository of national geography and memory. The hand motif acquires new significance as an emblem of custodianship and sovereignty. Produced within GUPPA’s institutional framework, the poster’s linear clarity and bilingual typography enabled its circulation in diaspora and solidarity networks. The female figure operates simultaneously as metaphor for the homeland and as agent of its preservation. The work translates political ideology into visual rhetoric, asserting that culture itself constitutes resistance and legitimacy.",
          field_expert: "The poster exemplifies how Palestinian visual culture transformed heritage into a discourse of legitimacy and resistance. The monumental female figure’s embroidered thobe becomes a textile topography of belonging, and the hand-shaped vessel inscribed “Palestine” and “al-Quds” fuses devotional symbolism with territorial claim. The image allegorizes the nation through femininity: woman as land, mother, and custodian of heritage. Its stylistic clarity and bilingual inscriptions align with GUPPA’s program to create an internationally intelligible iconography of Palestinian modernity. The poster also enacts translation as diplomacy, addressing both internal and external audiences. Read through archival theory, it functions as an active agent resisting erasure by inscribing Palestinian civilisation within visual history. Its preservation within the Ali Kazak Collection and the Palestinian Museum Digital Archive ensures its continued role as a visual document of cultural endurance."

          young_visitor: "This picture shows a group of people walking on a long, dusty road. They are carrying their belongings, bags, blankets, and even small children, because they have had to leave their homes. These are Palestinian families who became refugees in 1948, during a time when war reached their towns and villages. Many of them thought they would return home after a few days, but they were never allowed to go back. The image tells the story of sadness and strength: even when they lost everything, the people kept walking together, helping each other, and hoping for peace. It reminds us that being a refugee means losing a home but not losing the dream of returning someday.",
          adult_visitor: "The photograph captures a defining moment in the history of the 1948 Palestinian exodus, known as the Nakba. Taken during the first Arab-Israeli war, it shows families forced to leave their villages and travel on foot across harsh terrain, carrying whatever they could. Abandoned vehicles on the roadside signal the chaos and suddenness of their flight. Over 700,000 Palestinians were displaced, many seeking refuge in neighboring countries or temporary camps under UNRWA. The image embodies both the trauma of exile and the enduring resilience of those who survived. It stands as one of the most reproduced visual symbols of the Palestinian refugee experience.",
          graduate_student: "The photograph documents one of the most significant and enduring episodes of forced migration in the modern Middle East. It portrays civilians, primarily women and children, moving away from their destroyed villages. The derelict truck and barren landscape visually encapsulate displacement. It functions not merely as documentation but as visual metaphor for the Nakba. The procession motif has become a recurring theme in representations of exile and statelessness. Scholars have interpreted such imagery as visual testimony corroborating oral histories of expulsion and challenging denial. The photograph participates in constructing a collective memory of dispossession and a geography of loss where exile is both physical and epistemic.",
          field_expert: "The photograph stands as an archetypal visual document of the Nakba, integral to both historical narrative and representational politics. Its provenance within UN photographic archives situates it at the intersection of documentary evidence and institutional witnessing. The image depicts an exodus of displaced Palestinians traversing a rural landscape punctuated by an abandoned vehicle. The framing recalls the iconography of biblical migration while functioning as modern political testimony. It renders visible the structural production of refugees as outcomes of war. The composition’s diagonal ascent suggests exile and endurance, while the juxtaposition of wreckage and movement embodies destruction and survival. The image persists in digital archives as a living artefact of contested memory."

          young_visitor: "This picture shows a group of people walking across a damaged bridge, carrying their bags and children. They are Palestinian families escaping from their homes during the war in 1967, known as the Naksa, which means “setback.” Many people had to leave everything behind when fighting began, hoping they could return soon. The bridge they are crossing is called the Allenby Bridge, and it connects the West Bank to Jordan. Even though the journey looks hard and dangerous, the people keep walking together. The photograph reminds us that when people lose their homes, they still carry their memories, families, and hope for a better future.",
          adult_visitor: "The image captures the human dimension of the 1967 Arab–Israeli War, known in Palestinian narrative as the Naksa. As the Israeli army advanced into the West Bank, thousands fled across the Jordan River via the Allenby Bridge, seeking refuge in Jordan. Preserved in the UNRWA archives, the photograph records this moment of mass displacement and the collapse of everyday life. Nearly 300,000 Palestinians were displaced, many becoming refugees for the second time. The stark composition, a line of people balancing over a damaged bridge, conveys both danger and endurance, a visual testament to recurring cycles of loss.",
          graduate_student: "The photograph constitutes one of the most iconic visual records of the Naksa, the second major Palestinian displacement following the 1948 Nakba. Captured by UNRWA’s official photographers, it exemplifies the agency’s dual function as humanitarian witness and historical archive. The diagonal line of refugees crossing the precarious bridge dramatizes the civil contract of photography — the shared vulnerability between subjects and viewers. The image performs a dual role as evidence and enduring icon of statelessness. Its institutional circulation demonstrates how photography humanizes and memorializes refugeehood, turning movement itself into continuity.",
          field_expert: "The photograph stands as a paradigmatic instance of humanitarian visuality within the politics of exile. Taken during the Six-Day War, it depicts Palestinians crossing the Allenby Bridge, a symbolic and material threshold between war and exile. UNRWA’s photography division developed a rhetoric oscillating between aid and documentation; by 1967, the bridge motif had crystallized into the visual grammar of displacement. For scholars of postcolonial visual studies, the bridge becomes a metaphor for transitional identity — from citizen to refugee, from visibility to marginality. Interpreted through Edward Said’s notion of exile as memory and displacement, the image signifies not only loss but continuity. Its austere repetition of covered heads and fragile passage transforms journalistic evidence into a visual monument of statelessness."

          young_visitor: "This picture shows a family sharing a meal together. The people are from the Ayyash family, and they are eating traditional Palestinian food outside their home. You can see dishes filled with rice, meat, salad, and bread; foods that are often made during special occasions or family gatherings. In Palestine, eating together is more than just having food; it is a way to show love, respect, and togetherness. The photo reminds us how families stay close, celebrate their traditions, and share joy through food, even when life around them is not always easy.",
          adult_visitor: "The photograph depicts a moment of family gathering and traditional cuisine in Palestine. Around the table, elders and younger members share dishes that reflect Palestinian culinary culture — meals deeply rooted in agricultural life and communal values. Such images preserve the essence of domestic and social continuity amidst political instability. In Palestinian culture, food expresses identity, hospitality, and heritage passed down through generations. The image’s warmth contrasts with dominant representations of exile and conflict, showing that Palestinian life continues through the everyday.",
          graduate_student: "The photograph provides a valuable ethnographic record of Palestinian domestic and social practices. While political imagery dominates much of Palestinian visual history, this image of a multi-generational family meal foregrounds the persistence of ordinary life and cultural continuity. The dishes correspond to the agrarian heritage of the West Bank, where foodways connect to land and season. Within visual anthropology, such scenes are acts of cultural resistance, preserving custom and communal ritual as forms of belonging. The photograph’s composition, elderly women at the center serving food, highlights the gendered dimension of cultural transmission. It connects to scholarship on food, memory, and nationhood, emphasizing cuisine as intangible cultural heritage under threat.",
          field_expert: "The photograph operates as an ethnographic tableau of Palestinian domesticity and social reproduction. It captures a group gathered around a table laden with traditional dishes, situating everyday practice within heritage and resistance. Its archival context reconfigures domestic photography from private memory to national testimony. The image exemplifies the politics of continuity: while Palestinian iconography often revolves around exile, the domestic space itself becomes a site of persistence. The shared meal enacts what Salim Tamari calls the moral economy of the household. The presence of elder women signifies the gendered transmission of heritage. Within postcolonial frameworks, the domestic setting serves as a counter-archive to narratives of loss, visualizing endurance through ordinariness. The documentation of such moments represents a conscious effort to construct a collective archive of intangible heritage, where everyday acts like eating and sharing become modes of resistance."

It was taken during the Children Summer Camp in al-Judeida, 1989, where people gathered to celebrate, talk, and spend time outdoors. You can see women chatting, laughing, and preparing snacks for the children. In Palestine, festivals like this are moments of happiness and togetherness, where people remember their traditions and show that joy and community are part of everyday life. It reminds us that even when life can be difficult, families still find ways to celebrate and care for one another.",
          adult_visitor: "The photograph documents a social gathering held outdoors during the Children Summer Camp in al-Judeida, 1989, a community event celebrating children and family life in Palestine. The image portrays women sitting together on the grass, sharing food and conversation, reflecting cultural hospitality and collective celebration. In Palestinian social life, such gatherings reinforce family bonds and express cultural continuity. Events like these highlight resilience under occupation, showing the persistence of joy, play, and normalcy despite hardship. The image becomes a celebration of endurance and togetherness through ordinary joy.",
          graduate_student: "The photograph offers an ethnographic record of Palestinian social and cultural life, revealing the persistence of communal traditions within political constraint. The focus on women seated outdoors, engaged in conversation and shared eating, visualizes what anthropologists describe as the politics of everyday life. Public festivals and community picnics have historically served as spaces of social cohesion and identity. This photograph, part of the Palestinian Museum Digital Archive, belongs to a corpus of domestic and civic images that counterbalance the iconography of conflict, asserting the continuity of cultural life as resilience. The act of documenting everyday leisure contributes to an alternative historiography grounded in endurance and community.",
          field_expert: "The photograph operates as a crucial artefact within the visual ethnography of Palestinian everyday life, shifting representation from trauma to cultural persistence. It depicts an intergenerational social gathering, women seated on grass sharing food within an open landscape functioning as leisure space and symbolic territory. The image exemplifies a civil gaze constructing citizenship through the ordinary. It challenges conflict-centered photography by foregrounding social intimacy as endurance. Women’s gatherings are read as micro-politics of belonging, enacting nationhood through care and community. The picnic setting reflects changing class and gender dynamics in late 20th-century Palestine. The image demonstrates how visual vernaculars of ordinariness reconstitute collective identity through continuity and how domestic images transform private memory into collective historiography."

Even though the city was hurt by bombs and fighting, children still played, families talked, and people tried to go on with their normal routines. It shows that even when things around them were dangerous, people kept their courage and helped each other. Life continues even in hard times, and kindness, friendship, and hope can still exist during war.",
          adult_visitor: "The photograph captures a moment of resilience amid the 1982 Lebanon War, when Israeli forces invaded Beirut and besieged areas populated by both Lebanese civilians and Palestinian refugees. Taken in a city under bombardment, the image focuses not on destruction but on the continuity of everyday life. It conveys the paradox of normality within catastrophe, showing that acts as simple as walking to the market or sharing a meal become gestures of survival. For many residents, daily life meant improvising ways to protect family, find food, and maintain dignity. Civilians organized communal support networks, turning crisis into cooperation.",
          graduate_student: "The photograph offers a crucial ethnographic lens on urban survival and cultural resilience during the Lebanese Civil War, particularly the Israeli invasion and siege of Beirut between June and September 1982. The image represents the civil space of photography, where ordinary citizens witness their own endurance through being seen. The war devastated Beirut’s urban fabric, yet daily life persisted through adaptive routines, street markets, improvised classrooms, and shared meals. The photograph’s focus on civilian activity challenges conventional war photography that privileges spectacle over lived experience. Within Palestinian visual culture, it resonates with diasporic experience, articulating infrastructures of endurance — the everyday systems and relationships that allow survival amid instability.",
          field_expert: "The photograph constitutes a critical artefact within the visual historiography of Middle Eastern conflict, capturing the persistence of life amid the siege of Beirut. In contrast to journalistic devastation, this image belongs to civil photography, articulating citizenship through visibility rather than sovereignty. Taken during the Israeli invasion of 1982, it documents how urban existence became an act of resistance. Beirut, both battlefield and city of endurance, saw social rituals persist within ruins. The image visualizes what Edward Said termed the aesthetics of steadfastness: asserting cultural continuity amid fragmentation. It bridges Palestinian and Lebanese experiences of displacement, situating everyday acts as micro-political assertions of humanity. Its restraint rejects spectacle in favor of ethical witnessing, transforming the mundane into historical narration."
